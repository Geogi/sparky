# Sparky

This Sparky *Twilight*, the successor to the now archived Sparky *Serenity* (formerly simply
Sparky).

Core differences are: use of Discord Interactions instead of ad-hoc command parsing, use of the
Twilight library instead of the Serenity framework, deployment on Microsoft Azure instead of Google
Cloud.
